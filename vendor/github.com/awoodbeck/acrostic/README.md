# Acrostic
A Go (golang) library that returns an acrostical phrase for a given word.

Initially, the library will return a series of adjectives followed by a
single noun for the given acrostic.  However, the intention is to extend
this library to flexibly return adjectives and/or nouns at the consumer's
discretion.
