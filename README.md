# xkcdpw
A XKCD password generator for high entropy, easy-to-remember passwords, based on the
["correct horse battery staple"](http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength)
comic. This app goes a step further toward making passwords
memorable in that it uses a series of adjectives followed by a noun (see
[gfycat.com URLs](https://gfycat.com/about)).

### Plans
* Add a web interface for generating passwords through a web browser.
